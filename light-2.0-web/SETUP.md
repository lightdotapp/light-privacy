# Light Waitlist Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Light waitlist website with Supabase integration.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works great!)

## Step 1: Supabase Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Click "Start your project"
   - Create a new project (choose a name, password, and region)

2. **Create the Waitlist Table**
   - Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Run the following SQL command:

```sql
-- Create waitlist table
create table waitlist (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  email text unique not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table waitlist enable row level security;

-- Create a policy to allow inserts (so users can join the waitlist)
create policy "Allow public inserts" on waitlist
  for insert
  to anon
  with check (true);

-- Create a policy to allow reads for authenticated users only (optional - for admin dashboard)
create policy "Allow authenticated reads" on waitlist
  for select
  to authenticated
  using (true);
```

3. **Get Your Supabase Credentials**
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy your `Project URL`
   - Copy your `anon` `public` key

## Step 2: Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

2. Replace `your-project-url-here` and `your-anon-key-here` with your actual Supabase credentials

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your waitlist page!
